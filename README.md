WP-Aggregator

This lightweight web application allows you to scrape and display the latest posts from any WordPress website in a visually engaging way.
It automatically fetches the newest 20 posts, lists their titles vertically, and generates QR codes linking directly to each post.

The newest posts appear at the top, and the list scrolls smoothly from top to bottom and back up, creating a dynamic continuous display.
The app automatically refreshes every hour to check for new content, ensuring that the feed always stays up to date.

At the top of the interface, the header contains a logo.jpg image on the left and a centered title.
The overall design is minimal, modern, and optimized for readability on all screen sizes.
